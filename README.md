Part-2

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation)

----------

 Part two of this project consists of refactoring the code to include an in browser GUI (graphical user interface). Instead of being a best of 5 rounds the new code should keep track of each game and announce the first player to win 5 rounds. I will also be adding some extra css to improve the appearance of the game.

 Instructions from the curriculum are as follows:

* ~~Copy your original code into a new file so you donâ€™t lose it.~~
    * **branch created**
* ~~For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.~~
    * **removed five round loop**
* ~~Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.~~
    * **buttons created using images and playRound is called on click**
* ~~Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.~~
    * **results div added**
* ~~Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.~~
    * **running total is display and winner is announced**
