For this project I will be creating a simple javascript version of rock-paper-scissors to run in the console.

Part-2

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation)

----------

 Part two of this project consists of refactoring the code to include an in browser GUI (graphical user interface).

* ~~Copy your original code into a new file so you don’t lose it.~~
    * **branch created**
* For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
* Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
* Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
* Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
* You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
